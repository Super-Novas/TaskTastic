## **Description**
TaskTastic is a task management web application with intention of keeping users' tasks and assignments organized. Targeted to a younger audience, TaskTastic has many unique features including the option to create different "spaces" to organize tasks, an archive, a history, and a profile page.

Supported by a user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation, the ability to create and manage different spaces can provide users with greater flexibility and control over their task management, allowing them to better organize their tasks and prioritize their workflow.

Furthermore, the archive, history, and profile pages enhance the experience by providing users with a centralized location for keeping track of their completed tasks, viewing their task history, and managing their settings and information.
